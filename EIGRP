EIGRP 
====

- This is an advanced distance vector and works on all the proprietory.
- It has max hop count is 255 and 100 by default.
- Administrative distance is 90.
- Flixibilbe in design.
- It is Unicast and Multicast.

There are three kind of tables- (--Sending and Receiving Hello Messages--Updates--Calculating Best Route--).
1. Neighbor Table: Each router introduces and share Hello message.
2. Topology Table: Share routing information and build topology table which tells about the best route possible.
3. Routing Table: Basis on best route possible, it creates routing table.

Packet Tracer:

1. Neighbor Table: Contains list of directly connected routers.
#show ip egirp neighbor

2. Topology Table: List of all best route possible learned from neighbor.
(Router shares the only best route possible irrespective of having multiple routes, this happens in EIGRP while in OSPF, router shares all the route possible.)
#show ip egirp topology

3. Routing Table: The best route to the destination.
#show ip route

- Updates are sent through Multicast.
- Hello packets are sent every 5 seconds and for 10 seconds in case doesn't receive any message.

EIGRP Metric: BW + Delay + Load + MTU + Reliability
Generally BW + Delay are used for calculation.
BW doesn't sum all the bandwidths, just check which route has the lowest value of bandwidth.
Lest Cost  = Best Route

Configuring EIGRP:
Router(config)# router eigrp <AS NO>   [AS NO: Any no between 1-65535, should be same one on both the routers in order to form neighborship]
Router(config-router)# network <Network ID> [All directly connected Network]
